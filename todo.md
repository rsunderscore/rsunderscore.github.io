# to-do list
- [x] research sassy css (used by jekyll sites)
	- sassy css is an extension of css which is an interpretted language compile to regular css by the sass executable
		- can be set up to run on a specified file or to 'watch' a directory for changes
	- two file types - both can reside in assets/css for the purpose of jekyll
		- scss - this is the new format and is more css like in syntax
			- statements end with ; and blocks are specified by braces {}
		- sass - this is the older format which is more python-like
			- no semicolon to end statements and blocks are indicated by indentation
	- inheritance
		- can include other files
		- can define mixin tags that can be re-used
	- variables
		- can bet set to single values or whole sections of css
		- set a width once and use it multiple times
	- nesting - allows you to extend the definition for included elements by specifying another tag
		- e.g. &-h1 would be an h1 tag inside the outer element (css version woudl require specifying the entire definition again)
