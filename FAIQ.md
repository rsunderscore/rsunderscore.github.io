I hear similar questions on iterviews so I'm putting some responses here to facilitate discussion:
- talk about a time you were successful, what was the project and how did it improve things?
- talk about a time when you were not successful, what were the repercussions and how did you deal with them?
- how do you deal with conflict in the workplace?  We are all working toward a common goal, better customer experience; whether that customer is a client or another department. Most conflicts arise from miscommunication or misunderstanding that can be clarified with further discussion.  It is important to maintain civil dialogue to generate common understanding.  If tempers are flaring it is prudent to take a break, I find that 20 mins is usually a sufficient cool-down period.
- what is the importance of diversity?  Diversity is key to success.  Everyone brings different perspectives based on their history and culture, and different perspectives lead to critical insights, innovations, and reduced errors.  All this means a better output for your customers, which will lead to more success for your institution.
- how do you handle situations where you have to follow a decision you don't agree with? Typically, I will voice my dessent and give supporting evidence via an email or other non-public forum and give the opportunity for further discussion.  If a leader decides not to follow my reccomendation then I trust that there are additional factors, of which I am not aware, that inform the decision.  In many cases it is difficult to gauge the potential of a solution without testing so it is prudent to try courses of action even though I do not initially agree.
