# A beginner's attempt to use git hub pages

I've spent some time attempting to get github pages working. So that I might be able to move my blog entries here.  I was trying to do blog entries on medium.com, but the code blocks did not have syntax highlights.

I tried to follow the documnetation over at [http://github.com/pages] but much of it assumes
that you have jekyll installed and you are running on *nix.  For example, the layouts information says you should put a header specifying layout:post for blog posts; but depending on the theme you choose, it may not have a post layout.  The one I chose did not have a post laout, so I'm attempting to steel the one from the minimal [theme pages ](https://github.com/pages-themes).  Hopefully it works.
