Most of my time lately has been devoted to handling my flooded basement so have been doing much data science.  I have been reading the twitters and these links look compelling.

- [180 data science projects](https://medium.com/coders-camp/180-data-science-and-machine-learning-projects-with-python-6191bc7b9db9)
- [common data science interview questions](https://towardsdatascience.com/10-highly-probable-data-scientist-interview-questions-fd83f7414760)

I also got a cool bundle of electronics books from humblebundle and have been reading up on the adafruit circuit playground.  Unfortunately most of text is devoted to microsofts drag&drop no-code solution for the platform.  My interest is mainly around circuit python.
