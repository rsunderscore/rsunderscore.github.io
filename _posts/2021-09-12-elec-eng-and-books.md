Reading through more of the electroncis books today.
- Adafruit circuit playground looks like fun - especially given python support
- FPGAs are a completely new concept to me - they say fast and affordable but Arduino and Raspberry Pi are cheaper - need to do more reading.
- breadboards look interesting but I need to know more about how to make functional circuits before I cand do anything with them

Also found that hugging face has a bunch of [datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets ) that can be used for analysis practice. Putting it here so I don't forget.
