## Working on Django

Per my last post I've been diligently working toward the goal of a hosted web application to serve as portfolio and work on collaboration.  I had been reading through a Packt text on django, which I've now completed.  So I'm now applying that knowledge to to various python projects.

I have various to-do lists throughout my life so that seemed like a good starting point.  

I also started migrating my spanish language work to a django app.  This currently takes the form of a simple vocab list but i hope to enhance this over time.
