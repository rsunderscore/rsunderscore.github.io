**Why rsunderscore?**  In my youth, I was encourage to post in on online forum, but I was reluctant to put my name out there, and I like cheeky jokes, so I devised the shortest username the forum would allow, a single underscore.  In most contexts this did not show up at all on the forum so the forum moderators were not impressed and asked me to change it.  So I added my initials in front.  I attempted to use rs_ as a username on other systems but most do not allow something so short or do not like the underscore character, so I spelled it out when necessary.

**Why now, why this web page?**  I obtained a Data Science mentor at my current employer who recommended that I increase my online presence to make it easier for employers to learn more about me.  Comment on linkedin, put code on github, and write blogs about projects if possible.  I have a vast library of code but all of it is propriertary to my employers so most of it cannot be shared.  In an effort to demonstrate some of what I know I'm in the process of devising hobby projects to post to github.  I attempted to blog about said projects on medium.com but have not been happy with their editor.  I noticed several packages I use were leveraging gihub.io for their documentation and that research led me here.


### on privacy 
Generally I stay pretty private and don't like to put my details on the internet, but as a consequence of making my resume available some of this is reluctantly out there.  On other social media my profile reads like: I am a person, that lives in a place, and graduated from a college.

### History
I've been a computer-phile since my youth.  I remember my first book on computers was heavily illustrated and narrated by a character with a CRT monitor for a head.  I did some BASIC programming and played with turtles on the rare computer that was made available to me.  In high school it was all the rage, among a certain set, to create your own web site so I started by HTML and Javascript books.  The only programming course that was available at my school was Pascal, but I was an artist at the time so I never took it.  In college I was a double-major for art and computer science, where I learned the complexities of programming, math, and oil painting.  Each professor seemed to have a favorite language: C, C++, LISP, Ada, Assembly Language, various flavors of SQL.  I had a book on Java at that time and insisted on doing a few of my projects in it, reluctantly permitted.  I also continued my web development education and developed web sites for various departments.

After college I did web development for a local newspaper, mostly with Javascript and HTML.  I taught myself VBA, and a bit of CGI, and learned some basics around IIS web hosting.  I also learned a way to dynamically load web content through clever manipulation of img tags, AJAX.

My next job was at IBM, where I learned about DB2, Apache, and much more CGI and Javascript.  I created interactive web sites to visualize, report, and alert on various data points for the IT infrastructure supporting IBM and its customers.  

After that I went to work for Bank of America.  Perl and CGI were not permitted, but they had a SAS license, so I threw myself into learning as much as I could.  Mostly I was processing IT server data from databases and flat files and using it for time series forecasting and alerting.  Eventually I was given access to a SAS BI server with all the bells and whistles, and I got to play around with the BI Dashboard and Information Map Studio.  Since SAS users were typically also into data science I learned some of the other major languages for data analytics and started exploring Python and R.  I had python questions for which I was unable to find answers, and where there was a SAS User Group at my company, there was no Python equivalent so I started one.  I've been focusing on Python since that time so I can present on topics for our members, and in turn I have learned a huge amount from them.
